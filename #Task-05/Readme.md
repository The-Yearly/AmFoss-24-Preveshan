
So while making this project I had a doubt whether to create a node server or not as the tasks did not mention anything abt node but the demo video showed the website being hosted in localhost 5500 so I decided to implement Node Server.
# TO Start
```node Server.js``` it is in localhost 8080
# Approach
First Thing I did for this project was trying to connect with https://fakestoreapi.com as I was new to implementing api in  websites. But I didnt find it diffucult and found the fakestoreapi documentation to be really good as they really help you like get a grasp on how the commands work and like what you could expect as outputs from those commands. After Impleting The Api I quickly made the UI part of the website. But the thing was I was really confused on the terminal part of the website on how it was working but after playing around the code for a while I realized It wasnt as complex I thought it would be and was actually reletively simple.
