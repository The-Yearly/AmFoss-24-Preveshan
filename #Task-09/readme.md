# Approach
This was the task i was exited to do the most as i always wanted to create an app off my own for a long time but never knw where to start. After watching basic flutter tutorial by fireship i found flutter to be really easy and felt it was like html css.
# Issues
flutter didnt install properly the first few times i tried it
also when implementing listview inside listview the app crashed a lot.this was solved by properly setting the dimensions of the containers
