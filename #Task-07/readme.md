# Approach
This was one of the tasks that I procrastinated a lot about. this was because like a long time ago i had tried BeautifulSoup4 but couldnt figure out how to use it. And with the added challenge of creating of a virtual enviournment I was really doubtful that i could do it. Only to realize that creating a venv was not at all a complicated thing and moreover with the help of proper tutorials BeautifulSoup4 too seemed easy. From their most of the downloading stuff was easy 
as i was able to easly implement them but the only thing that i didnt really understand was about the hash size filter. So after discussing with the person who made the task that doubt too was cleared for me. This is a really great task as it teaches u how to use BeautifulSoup4 properly and actually is a great tool indivitually which i can see myself using a lot
