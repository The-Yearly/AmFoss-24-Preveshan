# Approach
So First I Created My Bot Using Bot Father,After Which I watched few videos of telegram bots in youtube and found out that they were surprisingly easy to make. From there I connected it with googles book api and also learnt how to create and store data in local docx files and csv files.  After that everything was smooth sailing and I didnt encounter any issues. And I really liked this task a lot.
